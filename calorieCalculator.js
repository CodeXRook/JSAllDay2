/*
Challenge: The program will determine the actual and ideal calories 
you consumed last week. It will return a message based on if you ate too much 
or too little.
*/

// The first problem to solve is determining how many calories
//  you consumed each day of the week.

// Instead of writing seven different functions (one for each day of the week), 
// let's write one function with a parameter for the day


// return any given day's number of calories consumed
// it will accept an argument of 'day' and return a number
function inputCalorieByDay(day){
