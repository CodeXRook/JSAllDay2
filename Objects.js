// an object is a value type consisting of key value pairs.
// Javascript has two main value types primitives and objects.

// What is a primitive? Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, Undefined.
// and in ES6 Symbols

// Variables become known as properties 
// if a variable is part of an object it is called a property

var car = {
    wheels: 4,
    color: 'white',
    mpg: 34,
    engine: 5,
    gallons: 17
};

// DOT NOTATION

var car = {};
// object.property = value;

car.wheels = 4;
car.color = 'white';
car.mpg = '34';
car.engine = 5;
car.gallons = 17;

// BRACKET NOTATION
